        <p>The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle originally invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor
             and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was 
             licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978, and then by 
             Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.
            The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons 
            in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. 
            As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide, making it the world's 
            bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy. The Rubik's Cube was inducted 
            into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014. <br>
            On the original classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, 
            each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. 
            Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead, 
            which prevents peeling and fading. Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been 
            standardised with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red, 
            and the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise in that order. 
            On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.
            An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, 
            thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned 
            to have only one colour . Similar puzzles have now been produced with various 
            numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.
